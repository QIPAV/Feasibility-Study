\section{A short functional description of the project goals}

The main project goal in this project is to build two small (less than 2,5 kg) quadcopters, one with variable pitch, and one with fixed pitch. We also need to make sure the the quadcopter will work with both radio control, and an autopilot. The two quadcopters then need to go through several tests. The objective with this testing is to study the response time of a variable pitch quadcopter compared to a fixed pitch quadcopter. We are also going to study how variable pitch affects the power usage, compared to the fixed pitch quadcopter. \\ 
The two quadcopters must be as mechanically equal as possible to allow the best foundation for comparison.
