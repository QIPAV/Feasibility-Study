\section{A short functional description of the project goals}

The project goal is to build two small (less than 2,5 kg) quadcopters, one which will fly with variable pitch, and one with fixed pitch. We also need to create either an autopilot or modify one, so it works with variable pitch quadcopter.
The two quadcopters then need to go through several tests. The objective with this testing is to study the response time of a variable pitch quadcopter compared to a fixed pitch quadcopter. We are also going to study how variable pitch affects the power usage, compared to the fixed pitch quadcopter. The results from this testing is the main goal of the project.  \\
The two quadcopters must be as mechanically equal as possible to allow the best foundation for comparison.
