\section{An analysis of the problems and limitations. Is it possible to carry out the project?}

In all major projects it's always a risk to run into unforeseen challenges. These challenges can often result into a problem because of limitations in time, resources and money.
There are many factors that could stop or slow down our project progress. It is absolutely possible to carry out the project, but the question is if it's possible to carry it out within the given time and money. In order to minimize the risk of failure we did an risk analysis to discover the different scenarios that could be devastating for our project. (see risk analysis report).
