\section{A review of the resources that the project will require. For each activity}

The Start-Up Phase requires few resources other than a good amount of working hours. The same applies for the first sprint where we will mainly be working with design and preliminary studies. However we will need to have access to KIC and to the qualisys system. We are making the project vulnerable by relying on access to this system. Hopefully this will not be a problem. 
For the sprint second we have planned to continue the work from sprint one, and will not need any more resources. \\
\\
The third sprint need some components to actually start testing with the flight controller. We need a working quadcopter, which we plan to design and build our self. This will be however only a prototype which will be improved upon. To make the quadcopter we are at least going to need motors, propellers, connectors, ESC, a frame, a receiver and servos. This will of course need to be ordered in advance so we can have them from the start of the sprint. \\
\\ 
For the next sprints we will continue to improve the flight controller, related control theory and the mechanical design. 
Later we will finalize the mechanical layout, buy the parts we need and get a variable and fixed pitch quadcopter finalized. 
In the last sprints we will be working to finish all remaining testing and comparison.
