\section{Surroundings and related projects}

Our project surroundings will be in Kongsberg, Norway. Mostly in a room at the college university of south east Norway, and the innovation lab at Kongsberg Gruppen.
\newline
There are two other groups which are working with quadcopter related problems. One group is researching alternative charging options for quadcopters that operate out in the field. The other group is making an test bench which will generate data about different propeller and motor setups. We should probably share experiences with the last group about propellers and motors.\\
\newline
It exists a related project which is done by MIT in 2011, which consist of creating a quadcopter with variable pitch. Their project aimed to create a quadcopter capable of  aggressive aerobatic maneuvers superior to the typical fixed variable pitch quadcopters. \\
\newline
The difference between their project and our is that we donâ€™t aim directly at increasing the aggressive aerobatic maneuvering but to research the difference between variable pitch and fixed pitch quadcopters.
Another thing is that it is not commercially available (from what we've found).  Neither a flight controller for variable pitch nor scientific data about the performance differences between variable and fixed pitch.

More information on this is provided under the possible implementations section beneath.
