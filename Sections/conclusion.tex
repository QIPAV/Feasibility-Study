\section{Conclusion}

When taking into consideration the related projects, the functional description, different design implementations, limitations, activity layout and the corresponding resource usage, we can conclude that this project should be manageable. It might be a bit ambitious the way we want to execute when taking into account the limited time. 17 weeks to design and  construct two quadrotors, one with fixed pitch and one with variable pitch. In addition to create a flight controller from scratch, and autonomously control the quadcopter from an external source. Not to mention that the product is only 25 percent of the total project. Leaving a lot of extra work in between these weeks to work with another subject, documentation and presentation. \\
